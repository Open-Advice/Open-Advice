In 2005, the cyber cafe was the place to surf Internet as dial up connections
were very costly. During that time, Yahoo chat was very popular and I used to
visit \#hackers channel there. There were some crazy people there who said they
would hack my password. I was very eager to know more about hacking and become
one of them. The next day I went to cyber cafe again and typed “how to become a
hacker” on Yahoo search. The very first url was of Eric S Raymond, I was jumping
with joy that I had the magic key.
 
I started reading the book and to my surprise the definition of hacker was
“someone who likes solving problems and overcoming limits”. It also said
“hackers build things, crackers break them.”  Alas i wanted to be cracker but
this book brought me to the other world of hacking. I kept reading the book and
encountered various new terms like GNU/Linux, mailing list, Linux user group,
IRC, Python and many more. 

After searching further, I was able to find a Linux user group in
Delhi and got chance to meet real hackers. I felt like I was in an
alien world as they were talking about Perl, RMS, the kernel, device
drivers, compilation and many other things which were going over my
head.

I was in different world and prefered coming back home and find some
Linux distribution from somewhere. I was too scared to ask for one
from them, I was nowhere near them a total dumb newbie. I managed some
distribution by paying 1000 Rs to a guy who used to have business
selling distribution media. I tried many of them and was not able to
get my sound working. This time i decided to visit an IRC channel from
the cyber cafe. I found \#linux-india and jumped over asking “my sound
nt wrking”, then came instructions like ``no SMS'' speak and ``RTFM''. It
scared me more and took some time to figure out what RTFM meant.

I was terrified and preffered staying away from IRC for few weeks.

One fine day I got mail about a monthly Linux-user group meetup. I
needed answers for my many questions. I met Karunakar there and he
asked me to bring my CPU to his office as he had the whole Debian
repository available there. Debian was new for me but I was
satisfied with the fact that finally I will be able to play music on
Linux.  Next day I was in his office after carrying my CPU on the over
crowded bus---it was fun. In a few hours, Debian was up and running on my
system. He also gave me a few books for beginners and a command refernce.

Next day again in Cyber cafe, I read another ESR essay called “how to
ask question in smart way”. I was still visiting \#hackers channel at
Yahoo chat where i made a very good friend Krish who suggested me to
buy a book called “Linux Command Reference”.  After spending sometime
with those books and looking things up at tldp.org i was a newbie
Linux user. I never looked back. I also attended a Linux conference
where i met few hackers from Yahoo and I was really inspired after
attending their talk. Later after a few years I had chance to meet RMS
who is more like god for many people in Free Software community.

I would admit that documentation of ESR changed my life and that of
many others for sure. After all these years in the Free Software
community, I have realized documentation is the key for participation
of newbies to this awesome open source community. My 1\$ advice to all
developers would be to please document even the smallest work you do as the world
is full of newbies who would love to read it. My blog has even simple
postings like enabling spellchecker in OpenOffice to installing Django
in a virtual enviornemnt.
