\chapter{Use of Color and Images in Design Practices - Eugene Trounev}

Since the most ancient times people have used the power of images and color to
pass the information, draw attention, and distract attention. The infamous
saying goes - “Picture is worth a thousand words”, and it couldn't be more to
the point. From the way we dress, to flashy neon light of downtown stores across
the globe – every color, every shape, and curve has a purpose.

Knowing the purpose however is not that hard, since all of those variations of
hues and lines are put together to be read and felt by every one of us. It is
true therefore that a great design must come straight from the hears, as it is
supposed to speak to the heart in a first place. None the less, just the heart
alone would not be able to make a great design, if some rules are not set and
followed at first.

\section*{Colors and textures}

There are many different ways to classify the colors into categories, but may of
them focus on physical, or chemical properties of light or ink, and though are
important in the end, will not help you make an appealing design. The one way
that I found work best is to split colors into warm, and cool. Simply speaking
warm colors are those closer to the shade of red. They are: red, orange, and
yellow. While cool colors are the ones running towards blue, and are: green,
blue, and to the lesser extend violet. It's important to remember that cool is
also calm and breathy, while warm is impulsive and dangerous. So, depending on
what feelings you wish to awaken within your audience you should use either
warmer, or cooler colors. Draw attention with warm, and inform with cool.
Overuse of either will result in either overheating - creating negative feeling
in your viewer, or freezing-over – causing indifference.

It's important to remember that black, white, and grays are too colors. These
however are neutral. They cause no feeling, but rather set an atmosphere. The
properties of these will be discussed later.

Every image is first and foremost a collection of colors, and as such will abide
to the rules of color management. Determining dominant color of your image is
the key to success. Try to see the big picture, and don't concentrate on
details. A good way to do this is by setting an image against some dark
background, then taking a few steps back and observing it form a distance. Which
color do you see the most of?

Not all images have a dominant color however. Sometimes you may come across
color bloat, where no matter haw hard you look you can not determine which hue
dominates. Try to avoid such pictures, as they will inevitably confuse your
viewer. When confronted with imagery like that people tend to look away quickly
and it will not live a good impression, no matter what it speaks of.

Beside color, pictures also have a texture, as ultimately they are nothing but a
collection of textured colors. Detecting dominant texture of an image is not as
straight forward as it is color, as textures are seldom obvious, especially in
photographs. There are however a few pointers to help you. Human nature causes
us to be drawn to curved, so called “natural” shapes, while angular,
sharp-looking shapes are considered less attractive. That is why an image a
curved, green leaf would appeal to more people then that of a metal spike.

To summarize - the key to a successful, appealing design is a good, well
balanced combination between color and texture in the images used.

\section*{Texts and spaces}

The next equally important aspect of any good design is in the use of text and
spaces around it. And just like it is with the image textures and color, you
should always remember that people like to breathe. Meaning that there should be
sufficient space in and around the text to make it easier to spot, read, and
understand.

Consider an example of two pages - one coming from a romantic novel, while the
other is taken straight from a legal document. You would most likely prefer the
romantic novel over a legal document any day, but do you know why? The answer is
simply because you like to breath. A page from any romantic novel is likely to
contain three important elements: a) conversations; b) paragraphs; c) extra wide
margins, while most legal documents normally contain neither. All of the
aforementioned elements make the page fell alive and dynamic, while the absence
of those make it look like a solid wall of text. Human eyes, being more
accustomed to a certain degree of variety of sights, feel more at ease when
presented with spacious, fluid layouts.

This doesn’t however imply that every text must have all those three elements in
order to seem more attractive. Far from it. Any text can be made easy and
enjoyable by injecting enough air into the flow.

Air, or space can come through a variety of ways, such as: letter, line, and
paragraph spacing; content, section, and page margins; finally letter size. Try
to keep at least one character-toll space between your paragraphs and lines, and
two character-toll space between sections in your text. Allow generous spacing
around the text on page by setting your margins wide enough. Try to never go
below 10 points font size for your paragraph text, while keeping headers large
enough to stand out.

\section*{Attraction and information}

Just like animals human beings are often attracted by bright splotches of color
and unusual texture, and the more captivating is the sight the more oblivious
people become towards other potential points of interest. This simple rule of
attraction has been used since the most ancient times by both females and males
alike to drive the attention of others away from certain things they didn’t want
to be noticed. The best example of such a trickery is a work of a street
magician, who often distracts viewer’s attention by use of smoke, flames, or
flashy attire.

It’s important to remember here that words are visual too, as they produce
specific associations and visions. The very same trick that can be done with
smoke and fires can also be achieved through creative use of wording. By far the
best example of a trickery done with words is our every day price tags. Ever
wonder why retailers love those .99s and .95s so much? That is because $9.95, or
even $9.99 looks more attractive then $10.00, even though in the reality they
have same impact upon your wallet. Trow an “old” $10.00 price tag noticeably
crossed through with a thick red line into the mix and you got yourself a great
customer magnet.

\section*{Closure}

Great, attractive design is achieved by following these simple rules: a) choose
your imagery wisely; b) make a good use of colors and textures to create an
atmosphere; c) give your viewer some room to breathe; d) distract the attention
away from the parts that matter the least, and towards those that matter the
most.

This short essay is not meant to cover the whole wide specter of various design
styles, techniques, and rules, but rather to give you - the reader - a starting
point you could carry on building upon.
