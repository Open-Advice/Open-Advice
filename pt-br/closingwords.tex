\chapter*{And Now it is Your Turn!}
I hope you enjoyed our little roadtrip through Free Software. Now it is your turn to do two things:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Pass this book on. Share it with someone who would benefit from it.
 \item If you are not already contributing to a project start now. Today is the right day. OpenHatch\footnote{\url{http://openhatch.org}} is a great place to start.
\end{enumerate}
